# Fraud-Transaction-Detection
A machine learning-based solution to detect fraudulent transactions using classification models. The system analyzes transaction patterns and flags suspicious activity in real time or batch mode, helping financial institutions reduce fraud losses.



Features:

Detects fraudulent transactions using ML algorithms.

Supports preprocessing and feature engineering.

Visualizes fraud distribution and transaction trends.

Can be deployed using Flask or Streamlit.

Dataset:

Source: Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Contains anonymized features from credit card transactions (284,807 rows, 492 frauds).

Tech Stack:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)

Jupyter Notebook

Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

Flask or Streamlit for deployment

Installation:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/MyhfuzSk88/Fraud-Transaction-Detection.git

Navigate to the project: cd Fraud-Transaction-Detection

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Model Training:

Run the training script: python train_model.py

Or open the Jupyter notebook in the "notebooks" folder to explore and train the model.

Running the App:

For Flask: cd app python app.py

For Streamlit: streamlit run app/app.py

Results:

Accuracy: 99%+

High precision (to reduce false positives)

High recall (to catch most frauds)
